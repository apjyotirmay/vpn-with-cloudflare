Comprehensive Guide for Setting Up Wireguard VPN, PiHole, and Cloudflared with Argo Tunnel
This guide will walk you through setting up Wireguard VPN, PiHole, and Cloudflared with Argo Tunnel on a server, ensuring no ports are exposed to the public internet.

1. Provisioning a Server
Choose a Server: You can use a VPS provider or a home server with a static private IP address.
Operating System: Preferably Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later.
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose
Install Docker CE:
'''
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
'''
Install Docker Compose:
'''
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install docker-compose
'''
4. Install Wireguard
Install Wireguard on Ubuntu 20.04:

bash
'''
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireguard
'''
4. Setup PiHole and Cloudflared with Argo Tunnel using Docker Compose
Download Docker Compose Configuration:

bash

Copy code
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbencina/vpn/master/docker-compose.yaml
Modify docker-compose.yaml:
Replace [ARGO_TUNNEL_NAME] with your desired tunnel name.

yaml
Copy code
version: '3'

services:
  pihole:
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    container_name: pihole
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/New_York' # Modify time zone if needed
      WEBPASSWORD: 'your_password' # Set your desired web password
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    dns:
      - 127.0.0.1
      - 1.1.1.1
    volumes:
      - './pihole/pihole:/etc/pihole/'
      - './pihole/dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d/'
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    networks:
      - vpn

  cloudflared:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    container_name: cloudflared
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: tunnel --config /etc/cloudflared/config.yml run [ARGO_TUNNEL_NAME]
    networks:
      - vpn
    volumes:
      - './cloudflared:/etc/cloudflared'

networks:
  vpn:
    driver: bridge
Create Cloudflared Configuration:
Create a config.yml file inside the cloudflared directory with your Cloudflare credentials.

yaml
Copy code
tunnel: [TUNNEL_ID] # Replace [TUNNEL_ID] with your tunnel ID
credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/[CREDENTIALS_FILE] # Replace [CREDENTIALS_FILE] with your Cloudflare credentials file path
Pull Docker Images:

bash
Copy code
sudo docker-compose pull
Start Docker Containers:

bash
Copy code
sudo docker-compose up -d
5. Configure Argo Tunnel
Install Cloudflared:

bash
Copy code
wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb
Authenticate Cloudflared:

bash
Copy code
sudo cloudflared tunnel login
Create Argo Tunnel:

bash
Copy code
cloudflared tunnel create [TUNNEL_NAME]
Start the Tunnel:

bash
Copy code
cloudflared tunnel run [TUNNEL_NAME]
6. DNS Configuration
Domain Settings: Point your domainâ€™s DNS records to Cloudflare's nameservers.
Cloudflare Dashboard: Configure DNS settings to route traffic through the Argo Tunnel.
7. Configure Wireguard Client
Generate Configuration: Create a Wireguard configuration file for your client device.
Connect to Server: Use the private IP address of your server within your LAN.
Conclusion
With this setup, your traffic will be securely tunneled through Cloudflare's network using Argo Tunnel, with Pi-hole handling DNS requests and blocking malicious content. This configuration ensures a secure and private environment without exposing ports to the public internet.

Tips:

Regularly update your Docker images and system packages.
Review Cloudflare and Wireguard documentation for advanced configurations and security enhancements.
By following this guide, you'll establish a robust and secure network solution leveraging the power of Docker, Pi-hole, Wireguard, and Cloudflare's Argo Tunnel.
