This guide will walk you through setting up Wireguard VPN, PiHole, and Cloudflared with Argo Tunnel on a server, ensuring no ports are exposed to the public internet.

### 1. Provisioning a Server
Choose a Server: You can use a VPS provider or a home server with a static private IP address.
Operating System: Preferably Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later.

### 2. Install Docker and Docker Compose
#### Install Docker CE:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
```

#### Install Docker Compose:
```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

### 3. Install Wireguard
Install Wireguard on Ubuntu 20.04:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireguard
```

### 4. Setup PiHole and Cloudflared with Argo Tunnel using Docker Compose
Download Docker Compose Configuration:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbencina/vpn/master/docker-compose.yaml
```

#### Create Cloudflared Configuration:  
Create a config.yml file inside the cloudflared directory with your Cloudflare credentials.

```yaml
tunnel: [TUNNEL_ID] # Replace [TUNNEL_ID] with your tunnel ID
credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/[CREDENTIALS_FILE] # Replace [CREDENTIALS_FILE] with your Cloudflare credentials file path
```

#### Pull Docker Images:
```bash
sudo docker-compose pull
```

#### Start Docker Containers:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### 5. Configure Argo Tunnel

#### Install Cloudflared:
```bash
wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb
```

#### Authenticate Cloudflared:
```bash
sudo cloudflared tunnel login
```

#### Create Argo Tunnel:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel create [TUNNEL_NAME]
```

#### Start the Tunnel:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel run [TUNNEL_NAME]
```
### 6. DNS Configuration
Domain Settings: Point your domainâ€™s DNS records to Cloudflare's nameservers.
Cloudflare Dashboard: Configure DNS settings to route traffic through the Argo Tunnel.

### 7. Configure Wireguard Client
Generate Configuration: Create a Wireguard configuration file for your client device.  
Connect to Server: Use the private IP address of your server within your LAN.

#### Conclusion
With this setup, your traffic will be securely tunneled through Cloudflare's network using Argo Tunnel, with Pi-hole handling DNS requests and blocking malicious content. This configuration ensures a secure and private environment without exposing ports to the public internet.

Tips:

- Regularly update your Docker images and system packages.
- Review Cloudflare and Wireguard documentation for advanced configurations and security enhancements.
- By following this guide, you'll establish a robust and secure network solution leveraging the power of Docker, Pi-hole, Wireguard, and Cloudflare's Argo Tunnel.
